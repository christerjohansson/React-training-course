Welcome to the final part! Congrats! You've made it!

The final component of our trip through React-land is a call to get involved. The React community is active, growing, and friendly.

Check out the community projects on Github at: [https://github.com/reactjs](https://github.com/reactjs)

We've covered a lot of material in the course. The high-level topics we discussed in our course:

1. JSX and what it is, from the ground up.
2. Building components
   a. Static
   b. Data-driven components
   c. Stateful and stateless components
   d. Pure components
   e. The inherent tree-based structure of the virtual DOM
3. The React component lifecycle
4. How to build reusable and self-documenting components
5. How to make our components stylish using native React proptypes as well as third party libraries
6. Adding interaction to our components
7. How to use `create-react-app` to bootstrap our apps
8. How to integrate data from an API server, including a look at promises
9. We worked through the Flux architecture
10. Integrated Redux in our application, including how middleware works
11. We integrated testing strategies in our app
    a. Unit testing
    b. End-to-end testing
    c. Functional testing
12. We discussed deployment and extending our application to support multi-environment deployments
13. We added continuous integration in our deployment chain.
14. Client-side routing

## There is so much more!

Although we covered a lot of topics in our first course, there is so much more! How do we know?

Interested in reading more and going deeper with React? Definitely check it out. In later courses we will cover in-depth topics we briefly introduced in our first course, we go into a ton of other content, including (but not limited to):

- Using graphql and how to build a GraphQL server
- Relay and React
- How to use React to build a React Native application
- How to extend React Native to use our own custom modules
- An in-depth, much more comprehensive review of testing, from unit tests through view tests
- A deep look into components, from an internals perspective
- Advanced routing and dealing with production routing
- Forms forms forms! We cover form validations, from basic form inputs through validating and integrating with Redux
- And much much much more.
