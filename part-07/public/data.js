          "Hi,\r\n`firestack.storage.setStorageUrl(someUrl).then(()=>{})` doesn't seem to work (keep throwing this error `cannot read property then of undefined`. I check the source code and see it no longer returns prosimify (..) and the way I did was i removed all the `then` in all `storage` functions so it doesnt throw an error on start up. Without the `then(function)`, the simulator runs without any error but the uploading doesn't seem to work (ie file is not uploaded onto firebase storage)\r\n\r\nJust in case May I double check if firestack does upload image from path? According to [this](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2016/07/firebase-react-native.html), react native doesn't support file or blob types, so uploading images might not be straightforward yet."
